# IndianRailway OOPS Project 🚆✨

## Overview
This project demonstrates the **four pillars of Object-Oriented Programming (OOPS)** in Java:
- **Encapsulation**: Private fields with public getters.
- **Inheritance**: `MaharajasExpress` extends `IndianRail`.
- **Polymorphism**: 
  - *Overriding*: Child class redefines `luxurytour()`.
  - *Overloading*: Parent class provides `luxurytour(String delux)`.
- **Abstraction**: 
  - Abstract class `maharajaservice` with abstract method `luxsuite()`.
  - Interface `maharajaexpress1` with abstract method `book()`.

This project is designed as a beginner-friendly showcase of OOPS concepts, using the theme of **Indian Railways**.

## Features
- Demonstrates **Encapsulation** with ticket and passenger details.
- Shows **Inheritance** by extending base railway class.
- Implements **Polymorphism** through method overriding and overloading.
- Explores **Abstraction** with both abstract classes and interfaces.
- Uses **anonymous inner classes** to implement abstract/interface contracts.
